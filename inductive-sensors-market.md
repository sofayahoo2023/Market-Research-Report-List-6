<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inductive Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self Inductive Type</li><li>Mutual Inductive Type</li><li>Eddy Current Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The inductive sensors market is segmented into three main types: self-inductive, mutual-inductive, and eddy current sensors. Self-inductive sensors detect changes in their own inductance as an object approaches, making them ideal for proximity sensing. Mutual inductive sensors, on the other hand, involve two coils where the presence of a target alters the inductive coupling between them, suitable for applications requiring precise measurements. Eddy current sensors utilize electromagnetic induction to detect metallic objects, offering high precision and sensitivity in various industrial settings.</p></p>
