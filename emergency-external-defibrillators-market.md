<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emergency External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Emergency External Defibrillators market can be categorized into semi-automated and fully automated devices. Semi-automated defibrillators require the operator to deliver a shock after the device assesses the heart rhythm, providing auditory or visual prompts to guide users. In contrast, fully automated defibrillators analyze the heart rhythm and deliver a shock automatically without any user intervention. Both types are crucial for emergency situations, enhancing survival rates during cardiac arrest by facilitating prompt defibrillation to patients.</p></p>
