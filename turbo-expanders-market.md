<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turbo-expanders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Turbo-expander</li><li>Axial Turbo-expander</li><li>Radial-Axial Turbo-expander</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The turbo-expander market comprises three primary types: radial turbo-expanders, axial turbo-expanders, and radial-axial turbo-expanders. Radial turbo-expanders utilize a centrifugal force to expand gases and are known for high efficiency in low flow applications. Axial turbo-expanders, on the other hand, use a series of blades aligned along the axis for higher flow rates and efficiency in larger applications. Radial-axial turbo-expanders combine features of both designs, optimizing performance across a broader range of operating conditions.</p></p>
