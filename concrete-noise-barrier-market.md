<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The concrete noise barrier market consists of two primary types: ground-mounted and structure-mounted noise barriers. Ground-mounted noise barriers are installed along the ground to mitigate noise from highways, railways, or industrial areas, effectively blocking sound waves. In contrast, structure-mounted noise barriers are integrated into existing structures, such as buildings or bridges, to reduce noise pollution in urban environments. Both types are essential for enhancing acoustic comfort and ensuring compliance with noise regulations in populated areas.</p></p>
