<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Control Servo Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cored Motor</li><li>Coreless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Radio Control Servo market features two primary types: cored and coreless motors. Cored motors utilize a steel core to generate magnetic fields, offering high torque but heavier weight. They are commonly found in budget-friendly applications. In contrast, coreless motors eliminate the iron core, resulting in lower inertia and faster response times, making them ideal for precision tasks. Coreless servos are typically lighter and more efficient, catering to high-performance needs in advanced hobbyist and professional applications.</p></p>
